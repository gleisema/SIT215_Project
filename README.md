# SIT215_Project
Reinforcement Learning Project with OpenAI Gym

## Using Jupyter Notebook:
In order to run both “taxi.ipynb” and “cartpole.ipynb”, Jupyter Notebook can be installed using the following instructions:

JupyterLab can be installed using conda or pip. For more detailed instructions, consult the installation guide at https://jupyter.org.

### conda
If you use conda, you can install it with:
<code>conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab</code>

### pip
If you use pip, you can install it with:
<code>pip install jupyterlab</code>

If installing using pip install --user, you must add the user-level bin directory to your PATH environment variable in order to launch jupyter lab. If you are using a Unix derivative (FreeBSD, GNU / Linux, OS X), you can achieve this by using export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" command.

Reference: https://jupyter.org/install

Once installed. Navigate to the folder containing “taxi.ipynb” and “cartpole.ipynb” in CLI and type the command ‘jupyter notebook”.  A tab will then be opened in your browser, which you can use to navigate to either of the files.

To run a cell, click on the arrow in the top left corner or the cell.
To restart kernels, or stop execution, click on the restart symbol or the square symbol in the top bar of the page.

## Taxi Problem
Before execution the Random Policy Algorithm and Q-Learning Algorithm. Run cells 1 and 2 to set up the environment.

To execute Random Policy Algorithm, run cell 3.

To execute Q-Learning Algorithm, run cells 4-5.

To visualise the performance of the algorithms, run cells 6-9.

## CartPole Problem
Before execution the Random Policy Algorithm and Q-Learning Algorithm. Run cells 1 and 2 to set up the environment.

To execute Random Policy Algorithm, run cell 3.

To execute Q-Learning Algorithm, run cells 4-6.

To visualise the performance of the algorithms, run cells 7-9.
